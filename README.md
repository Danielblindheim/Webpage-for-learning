# Webpage-for-learning
This is a project that I am doing to practice html, css, javascript mainly. I will also be applying php and other things to this project, and redirect my learning to this project, to be able to showcase it.

01.04.2019: I realized how amazing php is compared to plain html. Previously I was copying about 60 lines of code into each of my 6 pages, and had to change all 6 every time. I realized I could just do insert the header into the beginning of each page with php, which is absolutely amazing.

Not sure what to do with the login system yet, but hoping for it to save to-do lists by user over time, but not sure yet.
