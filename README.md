Breakthrough: 01.04.2019 I realized how amazing php is compared to plain html. Previously I was copying about 60 lines of code into each of my 6 pages, and had to change all 6 every time. I realized I could just do insert the header into the beginning of each page with php, which is absolutely amazing.
